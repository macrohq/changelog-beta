## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble running the newest version of Macro, try these troubleshooting steps:

 1. Drag the Macro Bets app into Trash, wait about a minute, and then empty trash. This will give you a clean slate for installation.
 2. Re-install the most recent beta .dmg file. Make sure to remove Macro Beta from your computer before doing this step!
 3. Check that the version you are running is the current release by clicking on Macro > About Macro in the menu bar. If you are behind, try steps 1 and 2.
