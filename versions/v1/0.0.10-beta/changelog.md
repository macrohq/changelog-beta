### ðŸ”— Zoom Link Auto-open
 - There was an issue where you'd click on a Zoom link and it wouldn't open in Macro. Isn't that the whole point?!? So yeah, it's fixed now.

### ðŸ’¬ Chat Links
 - We used to show links in chat in a black text that just so happened to basically be the same as the background color. You can see it now!

### ðŸ¤— Twemojiii
 - System defaults are lame. Let's do ALL TWEMOJI!
