# v0.0.11-beta


### ðŸš§ Backup Plan
 - There are a few things that we just can't handle yet (like E2EE meetings, webinars, and large meetings over 30 people). If any of those things come up, we now prompt you to switch over to normal Zoom. :(

### ðŸª² Bug Fixes
 - We've added more domains to our no-go list since some email domains are used by multiple teams (i.e. @hey.com).
 - To make your life easier, we do a bit more checking on any URL you paste into the meeting link input box on the home screen.
