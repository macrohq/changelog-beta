# v0.0.16-beta

### 🤝 Screenshare Updates
 - The #1 issue for the beta has been frozen screensharing. There has been an issue with this for a while and we were FINALLY able to switch to the new Zoom SDK version! Now, sharing an app in the toggled view will work perfectly again.

### 🕰️ Tick, Tock Rendering
 - Since we track airtime in real-time, much of our app needs to update each second. This can cause CPU to spike or get a little wild. One of our engineers found a super slick workaround to make the entire app less computationally intensive!
