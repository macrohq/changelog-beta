# v0.0.2-beta

### 🤐 Non-Macro Airtime 
 - The airtime map was showing data for Macro users but not for the Zoom users in the meeting. Now it shows all the users in the meeting, regardless of what client they use.

### 🌉 Virtual Backgrounds
 - Virtual backgrounds were not working when on the new beta version due to some changes in the Zoom SDK. We've added a workaround to ensure you can have the Golden Gate Bridge behind you once again!
