### 🔗 Link Rooms
 - You can now create Rooms with existing zoom links! think of this like bookmarking zoom links you join regularly, and this works for both personal or company zoom accounts! 

### 🧋 Resizing Window Video Bubble Behavior
 - When resizing the window, the video bubbles would get cutoff. We’ve updated that logic. This is a first step in making the resizing behavior a lot better, more to come! 

### 🎙️ Host Unable to Record / Screenshare Issue
 - Occasionally if you were the host of the meeting macro would say that recording / screen sharing had been disabled, this has been fixed

### 🪂 0% Airtime Bug
 - Airtime would occasionally break and show 0% for some or all attendees in the meeting due to server connection issues. This shouldn’t happen anymore!
