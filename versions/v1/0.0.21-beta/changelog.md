# v0.0.21-beta

### ⭕ Interruption Detection
 - Back by popular demand, we've added interruption detection back into the Macro app! Now you can see in real time when attendees speak at the same time.

### 📟 Google Meet Links
 - Even though we optimize for Zoom, we want to allow you to join your Meet meetings too. Now, you can just click on the meeting in your Macro homescreen and it will launch either Zoom or Meet!

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
 - We've updated the backend to make everything faster!
 - We turned down the volume on the Macro app sounds a bit.
