# v0.0.22-beta

### 🏎️ Join Meetings Faster
 - We've redesigned the pre-meeting windows to speed up the time it takes for you to get in your meeting. Now, you can check out what your video will look like and choose between Macro or Zoom all at once!

### 👻 New Zoom Features
 - Zoom has released a new SDK so you'll get new features like background blur and video virtual backgrounds in Macro now. This update also fixes some bugs that were in the previous Zoom SDK.
