### 🤳 Camera Filters
 - The moment you've all been waiting for has finally arrived! After a ton of work, we're excited to launch MacroCam. This new virtual cam lets you pick filters that everyone on the call (even Zoom users) can see. And this is just the tip of the iceberg...

### 👩‍💻 Screenshare Bugs
 - Screenshare would occasionally start off as a black screen. This is now fixed!
 - When popping the screenshare back in to the window, the video thumbnails would get all wonky. Now they'll be nice and orderly!
