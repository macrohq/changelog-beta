### 🥘 Pannable Canvas
 - Ever have a video get pushed outside of the Macro window? Now you can pan the canvas around just like Figma and never lose a video again! Even more canvas functionality is coming soon.

### 🍭 Revamped Active Speaker
 - We've got a ton of updates in the pipeline to add more color and customization to Macro. One of the first is a new, rainbow active speaker ring that adds a pop of color to your meetings.

### 🙈 Hide Self View
 - Zoom fatigue is often caused by looking at yourself all day. Now you can go into the video menu and `Toggle Self View` to blur out your own face and focus on everyone else.
