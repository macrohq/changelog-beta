# v0.0.25-beta

### 🪂 Airtime Refactor
 - Airtime is consistently on of the most popular features of Macro. We spent the past few weeks making it more robust and reliable for all of you!

### ⚛️ Electron Updates
 - The Macro client runs on Electron and we were running so old versions that weren't optimized for what we're doing. We've done a whole host of updates which will make your experience less buggy and more delightful!
 
### 💥 Crash Protection
 - Integrating with Zoom is a bit like living in the Wild West at times. We dove deep into the SDK and added low-level memory protection so you see fewer crashes in Macro.
