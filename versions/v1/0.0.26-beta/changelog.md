# v0.0.26-beta

### ‚òéÔ∏è Phone / Call-in Attendees
 - With the previous version of Macro, the app would crash if an attendee had called into the meeting with the "Dial In" method. We've added some additional workarounds to make sure this no longer kicks you out of the meeting!

### ü§ê Password Error Handling
 - Occasionally Zoom will throw a password error if you're idle in a meeting for too long. Now we gracefully exit the meeting so you can keep using the app without issue.
