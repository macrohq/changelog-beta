### 🎦 Screenshare Improvements
 - Easy screensharing is one of the most important things for a successful collaboration tool. We've spent the past week working on making our screenshare experience more robust and bug-free!

### 🥑 Ready Check Speedup 
 - Getting you into your meeting fast is a top priority for the Macro team. The ready check is now seconds faster when launching into a meeting!
 
### 🌐 Network Error Handling
 - We found an issue with Node that causes sporadic network request errors (which basically breaks Macro). Now we've updated the way we send request to our API which should fix this.
