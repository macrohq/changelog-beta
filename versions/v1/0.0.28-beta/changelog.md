# v0.0.28-beta

### 🤏 Pinch to Zoom
 - First there was panning and now there is zooming! The canvas can now be manipulated to make videos bigger, smaller, and in different areas. Have fun moving all your co-workers around and zooming in to their lovely faces.
 
### 🧰 Zoom Launch Handling
 - Sometimes you just want to use Zoom. We get it. We've spent the last few weeks making sure that you can get into Zoom or Macro as quickly as possible and that Macro returns to home screen if you happen to pick Zoom.
 
### 🐞 Bug Fixes
 - There was an issue with adding screenshare permissions from within a meeting. This is now fixed.
 - We had a scenario where a ghost user would be stuck in waiting room. Not anymore. I ain't afraid of no ghosts!
