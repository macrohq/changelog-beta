### ✴️ Camera Shapes
 - If you like the color filters, get ready for shape filters! We now allow you to rotate through custom shapes to frame your video with. There are currently 7 shapes to choose from but we will be adding more in the near future. And the best part? People on Zoom will see you in your shape too so no need to worry about the weird thing on your shelf behind you. Just use CMD + SHIFT + K to toggle through the shapes and try it out!
