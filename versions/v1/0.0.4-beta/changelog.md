# v0.0.4-beta

### 🕹️ Moveable Collab Mode Videos
 - Just like in Macro 1.0, sometimes you want to move the videos in collab mode to a different part of your screen. Now, both the video panel AND the toolbar are draggable so you can customize your collaboration style.
 
### 🎷 Sound Effects
 - Why do video conferencing apps have to be so quiet? We've added some delightful sound to the Macro UI just for your enjoyment.
