### 🖼️ Canvas Freedom
 - Grids are for squares. We've moved to a fully customizable canvas where you can drag any video any place within the Macro window. Have fun making designs from your coworker's faces.

### 🏠 Macro Rooms 
 - Macro has always allowed you to join the meetings on your calendar. Now, we let you create and join spontaneous rooms with your team. Jump into Watercooler 💧 or create a new room by clicking the + on homescreen.

### 🎧 Audio-only Rooms
 - Did we mention that Macro rooms don't need video all the time? We've used Zoom's great infrastructure to give you seamless audio rooms so you can rest those eyes of yours. Just select audio-only when you create your next room.

### 🙊 Airtime Videos
 - Guess what? No more airtime map smack dab in the middle. Instead, the videos adjust larger or smaller depending on how much that person has been talking. Mind = blown 🤯
