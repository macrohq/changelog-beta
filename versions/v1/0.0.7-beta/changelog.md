# v0.0.7-beta

### ðŸŽ‰ Invitation to the Party
 - We've implemented an referral system for the Macro Beta. If you've used Macro before, you'll just be prompted to sign in again. If you're new to the game, you'll need to enter an invite code sent from an existing Macro user. Once you're on, click the + in the team list on the right panel of homescreen to invite the rest of your teammates.

### ðŸª² Bug Fixes
 - There were a few issues with how the Zoom SDK cleaned up memory. We've removed some code that occasionally led to Macro crashing unexpectedly.
