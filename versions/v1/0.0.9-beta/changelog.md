### ðŸš€ Macro 2000
Ok Zoomer...welcome to your new Zoom. We've done a 180 degree brand and design update to Macro and we're excited to hear what you think. Thinks you'll see:
 - Imperfection: we're all imperfect and the app mirrors this. Your video is now in an imperfect circle to decrease your Zoom fatigue and make you feel more comfortable.
 - Beauty: you deserve a beautiful experience in the app you're spending hours on each day. 
 - Simplicity: we've streamlined the app to allow to do the things you want to do quickly and easily every single time you use Macro.
